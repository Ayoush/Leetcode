Digits
is basically counting the number of digits that are present in the number. One way is to mod by 10 and then divide by 10. One more way is to find the log10 of that number and add 1 to it.

Reverse a number
is again related to counting digits. You have to mod by 10 and multiply by 10 and then divide by 10 and add to it and continue the calculation.

Palindrome is similar. Easy way is to reverse a number and match it with the original number.
